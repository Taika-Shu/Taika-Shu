# Reflections on the Ocean Project Group Assignment: 
In our most recent classroom group assignment, Mira randomly assigned us to different groups. I think this approach is highly recommended because the random grouping brought more diversity to our team, leading to more intellectual collisions during the Scrum process. From my previous work experience, I’ve learned that it’s essential to conduct an assessment before starting any project. This includes evaluating the workload, budget, personnel, and the stress associated with the project timeline. My approach received positive feedback from the group.

Other members of our group contributed valuable ideas. Bem (maybe spelled like this) suggested focusing on basic infrastructure, such as WiFi, 5G, water, and electricity. Cristi proposed creating a map of the town and working on transportation infrastructure. Tharaka participated in discussions about the priority of building construction and patiently listened to everyone’s ideas. Eino suggested growing vegetables and raising cattle and chickens on the island. He also played the role of determining the feasibility of the plans we proposed. We were quite satisfied with our work, as everyone shared their ideas, and each of us earned full marks. Bem was particularly outstanding.

However, when other groups began sharing their results, I noticed that their work was more detailed and specific. They even had maps of the island drawn out, with floor plans of factories and the purpose of each room clearly defined. After seeing the presentations of the two groups before us, I began to doubt whether we had done something wrong or misunderstood the assignment. But in Finnish education, there’s no right or wrong in open-ended tasks. When we received this assignment, we positioned ourselves more as project managers, planning the project timeline and process. For the detailed parts, we preferred to consult professionals to create the maps.
